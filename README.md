### The Absent Gardener

The Absent Gardener is a small interactive browser experience about tending a digital garden, and seeing how it grows.

#### Process

After lots of brainstorming and amorphous pondering I really began with a paper prototype to structure the experience. I later fleshed this out in Figma for a more hi-res experience. After receiving some feedback on the prototypes I began coding from what I thought was the most important thing: the flowers.

I pulled the colors from [nice-color-palettes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nice-color-palettes) so the flowers would be a bit more cohesive. After developing the variety in populations of roses I moved to a grid-based system where each cell had a random rose from a random population of flowers. There are currently 3 populations max.

#### To-Dos

#### Inspiration

This project came out of exploring genetic algorithms, Animal Crossing, Ursula K LeGuin, and COVID-19. Genetic algorithms explore computational simulation of natural phenomenon. Animal Crossing celebrates the mundane, and creates a system that makes one eager to water and breed flower beds every day. Ursula K LeGuin (namely her short story Birthday of The World) reminds us that worlds end over and over again. COVID-19 necessitated isolation as care, time stretched long and short, and we all had to relinquish the idea of control.

The tone of this piece is heavily influenced by [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year), [the Yawhg](http://www.theyawhg.com/), and [Kentucky Route Zero](http://kentuckyroutezero.com/).

### The Absent Gardener

The Absent Gardener is a small interactive browser experience about tending a digital garden, and seeing how it grows.

#### Process

I used Figma to create a sketch of the website with placeholder copy. The fact that I didn't fine tune the spacing at this stage meant that I lost a lot of time in the code. During the poster project, the meticulous measurements really paid of when I got to coding. I also didn't think carefully about what elements would be dynamic and responsive. Rushing this step meant that I was tweaking for a long time.

#### To-Dos

#### Inspiration

This project came out of exploring genetic algorithms, Animal Crossing, Ursula K LeGuin, and COVID-19. Genetic algorithms explore computational simulation of natural phenomenon. Animal Crossing celebrates the mundane, and creates a system that makes one eager to water and breed flower beds every day. Ursula K LeGuin (namely her short story Birthday of The World) reminds us that worlds end over and over again. COVID-19 necessitated isolation as care, time stretched long and short, and we all had to relinquish the idea of control.

The tone of this piece is heavily influenced by [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year), [the Yawhg](http://www.theyawhg.com/), and [Kentucky Route Zero](http://kentuckyroutezero.com/).
